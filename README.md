# Embus-IoT
A prototype to detect and avoid foot boarding in buses

Components required:

Arduino UNO,
Motor Driver,
HX711 Load cell amplifier,
Load cell,
DC Motors,
LCD display,
Buzzer,
GSM module.

Developed a system to prevent the tragedies resulting from footboard travelling in buses. The basic principle behind the working of the proposed system is to halt the bus from moving when someone stands on the footboard and send a message to the concerned authority. The system makes sure that the bus moves only when the footboard is cleared. This system can be used mainly in metropolitan cities in India where footboarding is rampant.
